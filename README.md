## ❓ Problem Statement
Job portal platforms usually face significant challenges in handling large-scale user traffic, resulting in slow query performance, poor user experience, and system instability. Managing complex job matching algorithms and user data operations becomes increasingly difficult as the platform grows.



## ✅ Solution
So, I designed and developed a scalable monolithic backend system using Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB deployed on AWS. Implemented MongoDB aggregation pipelines for optimized data retrieval, integrated rate limiting and Zod validation for security, and followed clean architecture principles with modular design and centralized error handling to efficiently support 100k+ concurrent users.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **Scalable Architecture** designed for high concurrency and future growth
- 🧮 **MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines** for optimized data querying
- 🚦 **Rate Limiting** to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage
- 🔐 **Robust Middleware** for authentication, authorization, and error handling
- 🧾 **Zod Validation** for runtime request validation
- 📄 **Logging System** for debugging and observability
- ☁️ **AWS Deployment** for scalability and reliability

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Validation:** Zod  
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2 / S3 / PM2  
- **Others:** dotenv, morgan, cors, helmet, express-rate-limit, winston
